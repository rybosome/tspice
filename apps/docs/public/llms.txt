## Non-goals / do not assume

- This repo does **not** ship SPICE kernels; callers must provide kernels (LSK/SPK/FK/etc) appropriate to their use case.
- Do not assume `backend: "node"` is available everywhere; it depends on a native addon (Node.js (native addon)). Prefer `backend: "wasm"` for browser/WebWorker (WASM) portability.
- Do not assume network access; kernel bytes may come from local files, fetch, or other sources.
