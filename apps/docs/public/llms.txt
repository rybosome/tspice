# tspice

TypeScript-first wrapper around NAIF SPICE (CSPICE), with multiple backends (WASM + Node/native).

This file (and its sibling artifacts) are generated by `pnpm generate:llm`.

## Artifacts

- Full LLM-focused documentation + typechecked golden examples: `./llms-full.txt`
- JSON schema for tool/integration builders (common kit operations): `./tspice.schema.json`

Hosted (GitHub Pages):

## Policies / disclosures (repo files)

- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`

## Non-goals / do not assume

- This repo does **not** ship SPICE kernels; callers must provide kernels (LSK/SPK/FK/etc) appropriate to their use case.
- Do not assume `backend: "node"` is available everywhere; it depends on a native addon. Prefer `backend: "wasm"` for portability.
- Do not assume network access; kernel bytes may come from local files, fetch, or other sources.
