## Omitted routines (not targeted)

A small number of CSPICE routines are marked as not targeted (3 total). These are routines that don't translate well to tspice's scope:

- **Fortran unit I/O (non-portable)**: 1 routines (e.g. `ftncls_c`)
- **interactive I/O / CLI**: 2 routines (e.g. `getcml_c`, `prompt_c`)
